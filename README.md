>>> Python - Kaggle(7courses) - handwritten notes - attached as acm.zip
           - Kaggle  User ID:12711280 User Name: adyasrivastava
>>> Blackjack Code(inspired by questions on kaggle course)
>>> Python - Corey Schafer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7&index=2
>>> NumPy- FreeCodeCamp - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI
>>> NumPy - NumPy Docs - attached as NumPy practice
>>> Matplotlib - basics level only - can be looked for in NumPy practice and Pandas files
>>> Pandas - Exploratory Data Analysis - attached by the exact name file 
           - Visual Data Analysis in Python - attached by the exact name file
>>> David Silver's Lectures - Introduction to Reinforcment Learning
                            - Markov Decision Process
                            - Planning by Dynamic Programming
                            - Model-Free Prediction
    ( I made markup notes on downloaded slides as the lectures proceeded)
    (P.S. I cant attach proof bcoz somehow only the first slide for the above lectures was saved on the ipad, so I lost my notes as well,lol)
