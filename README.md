# ACM-round-2
Documenting everything I have learnt(in order) and how I went about it:
>>> Python - Kaggle(7courses) - handwritten notes - attached as acm.zip
           - Kaggle  User ID:12711280 User Name: adyasrivastava
>>> Blackjack Code(inspired by questions on kaggle course)
>>> Python - Corey Schafer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7&index=2
>>> NumPy- FreeCodeCamp - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI
>>> NumPy - NumPy Docs - attached as NumPy practice
>>> Matplotlib - basics level only - can be looked for in NumPy practice and Pandas files
>>> Pandas - Exploratory Data Analysis - attached by the exact name file 
           - Visual Data Analysis in Python - attached by the exact name file
   In Machine learning         
           
           
        
>>> David Silver's Lectures - Introduction to Reinforcment Learning
                            - Markov Decision Process
                            - Planning by Dynamic Programming
                            - Model-Free Prediction
    ( I made markup notes on downloaded slides as the lectures proceeded)
    (P.S. I cant attach proof bcoz somehow only the first slide for the above lectures was saved on the ipad, so I lost my notes as well,lol)
>>> Reinforcment Learning Course- by FreeCodeCamp - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELE2_Mftqoc
For this Video Im attaching the codes I did side by side the tutor
The video talks about Deep Q learning - agent uses convolutional neural network to turn the set of images from the game into a set of feature vectors 
                                      - Here, I have built the classic and generic atari game model
                                      - tools used numpy, tensorflow, gym etc.
Articles related to RL I have gone through - https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro2.html
                                           - Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning, Mnih et al, 2013. Algorithm: DQN.
                                 
In reinforcment Learning I have done upto Deep Q learning only. Contents from Policy Gradients is something I will start once Im done with practicising more models in deep q learning.
